# Pumpkin Catch
Game made for the Fall 2014 Pumpkin Jam based on the theme "The Hunt".  The game
and all assets were made from scratch with a team of 3 other students.  As team 
leader, in addition to programming, I delegated the various game development 
responsibilities to team members.

This game won 3rd place at the jam.
